# Arduino Project

This repository contains the design files for my custom Arduino project.

## Project Overview

This project is an Arduino-based design using the ATMEGA328-PU microcontroller. The goal of this project is to create a custom Arduino-compatible board that can be used for various DIY electronics projects.

## Components

- **Microcontroller**: ATMEGA328-PU
- **Resistor**: 1k ohm (R1)
- **Capacitors**: 22pF (C1, C2), 47uF (C3)
- **Crystal Oscillator**: 16MHz (X1)
- **Button**: 12*12*6-SMT (U2)
- **Headers**: HDR-F-2.54_1x2 (H1), HDR-IDC-2.54-2X3P (P1, P2)

## Files

- `Schematic_ardiuno_2024-06-28.pdf`: Schematic diagram of the project.
- `[Gerber Files]`:
- `[BOM.csv]`: Bill of materials.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Schematic and PCB Files**: Clone or download the repository to get access to the schematic and PCB files.
2. **Fabricate the PCB**: Use the Gerber files to fabricate the PCB from a PCB manufacturer.
3. **Assemble the Components**: Solder the components onto the fabricated PCB according to the schematic.
4. **Program the Microcontroller**: Use an Arduino programmer to upload your code to the ATMEGA328-PU microcontroller.

## Usage

Once assembled and programmed, your custom Arduino board can be used like any other Arduino board. Connect it to your computer via USB and start developing your projects using the Arduino IDE.
